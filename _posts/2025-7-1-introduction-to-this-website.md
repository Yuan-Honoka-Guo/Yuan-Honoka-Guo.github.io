## Fresh Off the Boat

I have tried to build a blog website twice before; and they all ended in me not renewing server plans (despite the fact that they are cheap).In general, maintaining something with a weird domain name and have 0 visiters are not so exciting for me.

## Why now?

I have to admit that I am kind of stupid to only recently know that Github hosts servers...... So good for me. 

Thank you Github and Paul Le for making open source Millennial theme.
