## Beer and Anime

I finished playing The Last of Us Part.2 3 days ago. In one dialog the characters talked about relaxing by watching anime and drink alcohol. 

Personaly, I am not a fan of beer, wine, etc. at all. However, as I had some Japanese wine with my friend at Sushiro the last day, I felt I was in a vibe to get some more and watch anime, only to test if the dialog was right.

I tried, and it was not as good as illustrated.
